# art2ASCII

A small project which maps intensity values of a pixel to an ASCII character to reconstruct and display an image on the terminal.
This uses a dictionary to map intensity values to a character.

Zoom out on your terminal to see the final result.

A great way to see the verstitility of the dictionary data structure and application of the f string feature of python.
